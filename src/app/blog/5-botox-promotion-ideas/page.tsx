            Most med spa promotions compete on price. A 20% discount here, a "buy two, get one" there. The problem isn't the offer — it's the strategy. Price-led promotions train clients to wait for deals, compress your margins, and attract the exact clients who are least likely to return at full price.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-[1.75] text-[#5C5C5C] mb-10">
            The promotions that actually fill your calendar — and keep clients coming back — compete on timing, relevance, and a little psychology. Here are five that work.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-[family-name:var(--font-playfair)] text-2xl font-bold text-[#1A1A1A] mt-10 mb-4">
            1. The Pre-Event Window Campaign
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-[1.75] text-[#5C5C5C] mb-6">
            Botox has a two-week onset window before results are fully visible. Your clients know this — or they should. Build a campaign around the social calendar: graduation season in May, holiday party season in late November, and the pre-summer push in April. Email your list exactly 18–21 days before the peak event window with subject lines like "Your results window is closing" rather than "20% off Botox this month." Specificity creates urgency that discounts never can.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-[1.75] text-[#5C5C5C] mb-6">
            Pair this with an SMS reminder 48 hours before your campaign closes. Open rates for SMS top 90% within 3 minutes. Use the channel accordingly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-[family-name:var(--font-playfair)] text-2xl font-bold text-[#1A1A1A] mt-10 mb-4">
            2. The Loyalty Re-Engagement Sequence
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-[1.75] text-[#5C5C5C] mb-6">
            Your highest-value Botox clients are typically on a 3–4 month cadence. When a client passes 14 weeks without a booking, they're at risk. A three-message win-back sequence — warm check-in, gentle reminder, soft offer — converts roughly 25–35% of lapsed regulars back into active clients. The key: personalize by name and, if possible, by their last treatment area. "It's been a while since your last appointment" outperforms any generic coupon.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-[family-name:var(--font-playfair)] text-2xl font-bold text-[#1A1A1A] mt-10 mb-4">
            3. The First-Timer Incentive (Without Discounting)
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-[1.75] text-[#5C5C5C] mb-6">
            New-to-Botox clients are the hardest to convert and the most valuable to retain. Instead of discounting their first unit, offer a complimentary consultation with the injector — 15 minutes, no obligation. This removes the friction of uncertainty (which is the real barrier, not price) and lets your injector build a relationship before the needle enters the room. Practices that offer this see first-timer conversion rates 2–3x higher than those running discount-only acquisition campaigns.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-[family-name:var(--font-playfair)] text-2xl font-bold text-[#1A1A1A] mt-10 mb-4">
            4. The Membership Anchor
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-[1.75] text-[#5C5C5C] mb-6">
            If you offer a membership program, Botox is your best anchor service. A "monthly beauty credit" that covers the cost of one area of Botox creates a recurring visit cadence, predictable revenue, and a client who feels like they're getting value even in months where they'd otherwise skip. Run an enrollment campaign in Q1 and again in September — two natural "fresh start" windows. Frame it as a lifestyle subscription, not a commitment.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-[family-name:var(--font-playfair)] text-2xl font-bold text-[#1A1A1A] mt-10 mb-4">
            5. The Refer-a-Friend With Shared Benefit
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-[1.75] text-[#5C5C5C] mb-6">
            Referral programs fail when only the referrer benefits. The best referral campaigns give both parties something — a credit toward their next visit, a free add-on, or a complimentary enhancement. Frame the ask around a shared experience: "Bring a friend to your next appointment and you both receive a complimentary lip flip." It turns a transactional referral into a social one. Clients are far more likely to share when it's an experience, not a coupon code.
          </p>

              The common thread
            </h3>
            <p className="text-sm leading-[1.75] text-[#5C5C5C]">
              Every campaign above is built around timing and client psychology — not price. When you compete on value instead of discounts, you attract clients who stay, refer, and upgrade. That's the foundation a durable aesthetics practice is built on.
